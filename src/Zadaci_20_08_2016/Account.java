/*
 * (The Account class) 
 *  Design a class named Account that contains:
 *  A private int data field named id for the account (default 0).
 *  A private double data field named balance for the account (default 0). 
 *  A private double data field named annualInterestRate that stores the current interest rate (default 0). 
 *  Assume all accounts have the same interest rate.
 *  A private Date data field named dateCreated that stores the date when the account was created. 
 *  A no-arg constructor that creates a default account. 
 *  A constructor that creates an account with the specified id and initial balance. 
 *  The accessor and mutator methods for id,balance, and annualInterestRate. 
 *  The accessor method for dateCreated. 
 *  A method named getMonthlyInterestRate() that returns the monthly interest rate. 
 *  A method named getMonthlyInterest() that returns the monthly interest.
 *  A method named withdraw that withdraws a specified amount from the account. 
 *  A method named deposit that deposits a specified amount to the account. 
 *  Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class. 
 *  (Hint: The method getMonthlyInterest() is to return monthly interest, not the interest rate.
 *   Monthly interest is balance*monthlyInterestRate.monthlyInterestRate is annualInterestRate / 12. 
 *   Note that annualInterestRate is a percentage, e.g., like 4.5%. You need to divide it by 100.) 
 *   Write a test program that creates an Account object with an account ID of 1122, 
 *   a balance of $20,000, 
 *   and an annual interest rate of 4.5%. 
 *   Use the withdraw method to withdraw $2,500, 
 *   use the deposit method to deposit $3,000, 
 *   and print the balance, the monthly interest, 
 *   and the date when this account was created.
